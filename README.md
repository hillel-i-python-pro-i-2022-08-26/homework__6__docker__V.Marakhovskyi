## 👨‍💻 Homework

Homework dedicated to Docker / Docker Compose.

### ▶️ Run

Make all actions needed for run homework from zero through docker container. As a result a small table with 5 rows will appear.

```shell
make d-homework-i-run
```

### 🪣🧽 Purge

Delete all created artifacts from run (stop and delete container).

```shell
make d-homework-i-purge
```
